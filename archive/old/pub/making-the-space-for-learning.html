						Learning unfolds within and across spaces, whether within school classrooms, across small
						outdoor tables, or on quiet library couches. Such spaces contain various elements that we use
						and experience. We find furniture to relax or focus on. We interact with objects, materials, and
						tools to assist our thinking and expression. We look for surfaces, lighting, temperature,
						colors, and acoustics to create a sense of safety and calm. When thoughtfully assembled, spaces
						and their elements can provide affordances for learning—offering architectures that support
						encountering new ideas, extending knowledge, practicing skills, and getting feedback. To what
						degree are the spaces in which we learn designed with learning in mind? This white paper aims to
						examine what is known about the qualities of spaces that support learning and offer guiding
						principles for designers of learning spaces to consider.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class=" col-md-12">
					<h3 class="mt-4">Linking Learning Outcomes & Spaces</h3>
					<p class="mb-4">
						Work in the past decade has examined the relationship between the qualities of space and various
						learning outcomes such as standardized literacy and mathematics scores. An array of studies
						suggest linkages between space typologies and student achievement through methods of qualitative
						interviews and surveys with teachers and learners, quantitative longitudinal regression
						analysis, and observations of classrooms (Kariippanon et al., 2020; Talbert & Mor-Avi, 2019;
						Vroman et al., 2012). While these veins of work have important methodological differences,
						several general and overlapping findings are useful for designers and educators.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						First, and perhaps the most obvious, is that effective learning spaces are designed with
						attention to basic conditions for physical safety and habitability. Buildings must be
						structurally sound. Rooms should provide good air and light quality. Settings should have
						suitable acoustics and comfortable temperatures, as well as adequate furnishings, such as chairs
						and tables, and not be overcrowded. Spaces should provide access to clean water, be sanitarily
						maintained, and have access to electricity. Research has shown that spaces lacking attention to
						such basic conditions contribute to lower student learning outcomes (Barrett et al., 2019; Uline
						& Tschannen-Moran, 2008).
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						Second, spaces that support positive learning outcomes are designed for optimal stimulation.
						Variations in colors and architectural elements provide visual complexity (Cox, 2018; Tanner,
						2008) and varied materials can produce different sensations of touch and feel (Davies et al.,
						2013). The experiential levels of visual, auditory, tactile, and other stimuli must not flood or
						distract learners. Conversely, a lack of stimuli can risk disengagement or boredom. Optimal
						stimulation is the goal: not too much that overwhelms and distracts, but enough to arouse and
						enliven learners’ experience (Fisher et al., 2014).
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						Finally, research suggests that spaces designed for learner connection lead to increases in
						various learning outcomes. Learner connections can take several forms. Spaces can support
						connections to self by enabling feelings of ownership and belonging in learners (Beckers et al.,
						2016). Spaces engender connections to others by offering views to see peers in other settings,
						visibly sharing work, assembling a mix of large and small configurations, and organizing school
						life in clustered neighborhoods (Tanner, 2009). And spaces create connections to surroundings
						through ease of movement, ample interior views, and views of the outdoors (Barrett et al.,
						2017). Designs with these types of learner connections have demonstrated a variety of positive
						impacts on academic learning outcomes.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						In sum, existing studies suggest these spatial qualities—spaces that are physically safe and
						habitable, have optimal stimulation, and foster learner connection—are linked to increases in
						academic achievement measured by various testing outcomes. While space plays a significant role,
						researchers also caution designers not to take an overly deterministic view: the teachers’
						pedagogical choices within spaces are equally, if not more, impactful on student learning
						outcomes (Barrett et al., 2019; Imms & Byers, 2017; Young et al., 2019). Therefore, designers
						must bear in mind how pedagogical experiences unfold within spaces.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						In that spirit, this white paper goes a step further by reminding designers that learning is
						more than what is evaluated in standardized tests or achievement scores. Designing spaces with
						affordances for learning must consider learning as both a process and an outcome. That is,
						spaces for learning must not only support what is learned but how learning happens.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-12">
					<h3>Linking Learning Practices & Spaces</h3>
					<p class="mb-4">
						How learning happens is evidenced by the quality of learning practices. Learning practices are
						processes learners engage in that build attitudes, knowledge, and skills. Research has long
						investigated a range of socio-cognitive learning processes of individuals, dyads, and groups.
						Such studies reveal the important activities that support learning, including how and why
						learners pay attention (Bandura, 1977), how learners flexibly think with and transfer knowledge
						(Perkins, 1993), and how learners give and receive feedback (Webb & Palincsar, 1996). Looking
						across this work, processes can be loosely grouped into types of learning practices, including
						but not limited to learning practices of noticing, wondering, and helping.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						Noticing is a core learning practice with processes that focus learners’ attention through
						slowing down for close observation, looking, listening, thinking, and feeling (Tishman, 2018).
						Practices of noticing often lead learners to practices of wondering, in which they are curiously
						asking questions, creatively exploring, and actively experimenting (Clapp, 2017; Ritchhart et
						al., 2011). As learners confront uncertainty and doubt, they often turn to others for advice,
						ideas, and support. Practices of helping include learners asking for and offering input,
						feedback, and guidance (Aleven et al., 2003; Calarco, 2011; Webb et al., 2006). These three
						categories are not offered as discrete or exhaustive. Rather, they aim to give designers a
						provisional purchase on core and interrelated learning processes from which research-based
						design principles can be derived.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						There is curiously scant research in school contexts that link spatial qualities and affordances
						to such learning practices. Therefore, over the course of a year, the authors identified and
						read over one hundred research studies from fields ranging from urban design, museum education,
						cognitive science, health care, architecture, and therapeutic counseling. Studies were
						summarized, discussed, and coded according to learning practices, research methods, and key
						findings. Through iterative cycles of sensemaking, the authors distilled the following
						research-based qualities of space, objects, and materials that support learning practices of
						noticing, wondering, and helping.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-12">
					<h3 class="mt-4">Constrasting</h3>
					<p class="mb-4">
						Gestalt psychology, a foundational school of thought for modern visual design, suggests that
						people interpret objects with the “simplest and most complete perceptual solution possible under
						the conditions given” (Dresp-Langley, 2015). When spaces, objects, and materials conflict with
						expected perceptual patterns, they create affordances for noticing, curiosity, and exploration.
						Whether an art exhibit sparks opportunities for a surprise, or a mixed-use neighborhood
						cultivates novel community interactions, environments with contrasting elements can encourage
						behaviors and relationships that foster several learning practices. This section examines
						various environments where designers and researchers have explored linkages between contrasting
						design elements to evoke practices of noticing, wondering, and helping.
					</p>
					<h4>Incongruity</h4>
					<p class="mb-4">
						When objects in one’s environment are perceived as out-of-place or surprising, it creates
						incongruity between expectations and reality (Paletta & Tsotsos, 2008). Objects and spaces that
						exhibit incongruity create unexpectedness, triggering attention and slowed movement and
						perception. For example, creating temporary installations in community spaces that change over
						time can increase the usage, lingering, and interactions between community members. Schlickman
						and Domlesky (2019) stationed temporary mirror installations in urban plazas and observed the
						behaviors of passersby over several days before, during, and after the intervention. People
						lingered around these mirrors, taking pictures of themselves and the respective cityscape.
						Similarly, Nikolopoulou et al. (2016) found that “mirrors as [environmental] interventions hold
						attention and heighten selfawareness,” noting that, “the greatest effect occurs when
						interventions are unexpected.” Likewise, an urban design study found that including new
						landmarks, trees, and local storefronts on extended streets slowed traffic speed in villages
						(Hamilton-Baillie & Mitchell, 2020). Intentional moments of incongruity in spaces can be useful
						in encouraging individuals to slow down and notice their surroundings with deeper awareness.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						Ambiguity also engenders unexpectedness, eliciting awareness and attention. It invites people to
						actively speculate and consider the different meanings and uses of the object (Montambeau,
						2018). Ambiguous objects, or objects with unclear meanings or uses, can stimulate curiosity and
						exploration. In their piece "The Pillow," design researchers Dunne and Raby delve into the
						concept of ambiguous objects. The Pillow is an inflated, plastic brick embedded with a digital
						display. The display responds to, both acoustically and visually, electromagnetic waves from
						various digital devices in its vicinity (e.g., radios, cellphones, etc.). The obscurity of the
						visuals and sounds emitted necessitates that individuals complete an idea of what the object is
						and how it could be used, ultimately inciting curiosity and engagement (Gaver et al., 2003).
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						After observing children interacting with recycled and discarded materials, Guerra and Zuccoli
						(2012) noticed that the ambiguity of unfinished materials positively impacts children’s sense of
						wonder and creativity. Such materials enable novel connections between information, thoughts,
						and objects. Studies also posit that children's interactions with “openended objects” (e.g.,
						clay, Froebelian wooden blocks, etc.) can spark and sustain curiosity, exploration, and
						creativity as learners construct new meanings for the objects (Cortés Loyola et al., 2020;
						Davies et al., 2013).
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						On a larger scale, Jelic et al. (2020) observed that designing non-standardized and openended
						play spaces presents challenges that nurture children’s curiosity and sense of wonder as they
						explore their environs. Openended objects and spaces that are incongruent with their
						surroundings afford opportunities for users and learners to lead their learning by exploring
						personal and intimate creations of meaning and uses.
					</p>
					<h4>Sense-scapes</h4>
					<p class="mb-4">
						By engaging a variety of human senses, including touch, smell, sound, taste, movement, and
						bodily awareness, individuals can experience instances of heightened awareness and
						contemplation. Schlickman and Domelesky (2019) note that plazas designed with soft surface
						materials and exposed to sunlight create a warm environment that encourages slow movement and
						lounging. Hamilton-Baillie and Mitchell (2020) also found that drivers tend to drive slower when
						they experience different physical sensations, such as vibrations or sounds produced by subtle
						bumps and variations in the pavement.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						Furthermore, diverse and sensory-rich materials effectively stimulate attention, curiosity, and
						exploration among young learners (Penfold, 2019). Cox (2018) coined the phrase “sensescape” to
						describe the range of stimuli in an environment and their role in supporting different learning
						tasks. As Cox succinctly explains, “The importance of the sensory aspect of this learning
						landscape reminds us that the body is central to learning.” Incorporating sensory variation in
						an environment creates various affordances for learning practices such as noticing and
						wondering. To exemplify, in a series of interventions called Urban Thinkspaces, researchers
						designed puzzles and movable parts at bus stops and parks to stimulate spatial skills and
						proprioception, or bodily awareness, to promote exploration and curiosity. These sensory-based
						interventions resulted in increased conversations and interactions between caregivers and
						children (Hassinger-Das et al., 2020).
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						However, it is essential to maintain a balance of sensory stimulation to ensure an appropriate
						learning space. Jelic et al. (2020) reference the work of Dutch architect Aldo van Eyck to
						depict how the purposeful absence of stimulation allows children to freely use their imagination
						and explore various uses of the space. Van Eyck’s playgrounds, aptly named “Tools for
						Imagination,” are adorned with abstract forms and playful sculptures, encouraging children to
						imagine new interactions with their surroundings. When designing spaces, objects, and materials
						for learning, it is important to implement a deliberate level of sensorial stimulation
						experienced by learners.
					</p>
					<h4>Spotlights</h4>
					<p class="mb-4">
						In a learning environment, objects and tools can also aid in focusing and “spotlighting”
						learners' attention. Spotlighting refers to the ability of a space, material, or object to
						enable a narrow line of attention. Spotlights can be predetermined for learners, or they can
						provide options for where and how they direct their focus.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						At the Field Museum in Chicago, researchers found that the use of prompted conversational cards
						that focused the attention of caregivers and children often led to elaborative discussions about
						curious objects, nonverbal engagement with the exhibits, and associative statements from the
						caregiver between exhibits (Jant et al., 2014). A similar study at the Carnegie Museum of
						Natural History found that families who explored dioramas with flashlights in dimly lit settings
						were more likely to establish joint attention and engage in educational conversations about the
						objects than in standard, well-lit environments (Povis & Crowley, 2015). In a more conventional
						setting, Hassinger-Das et al. (2018) used cleverly designed signage in local supermarkets to
						encourage conversations between children and caregivers in low socio-economic neighborhoods. The
						signs included questions such as, “Where does the milk come from?” or “What’s your favorite
						vegetable?”. This intervention resulted in a notable increase in caregiver-child language
						interactions in which adults used more descriptive language and children asked significantly
						more questions.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						The quality of environmental lighting can also influence a person’s ability to focus on oneself
						and others. For instance, dim lighting in counseling spaces can evoke feelings of pleasantness
						and relaxation in participants, resulting in greater self-disclosure (Miwa & Hanyu, 2006).
						Conversely, bright lights and resistant surfaces were found to increase “feelings of non-control
						over their environments” (Liddicoat, 2016). Properly designed lighting can lead to internal
						redirection, allowing individuals in a space to be more comfortable with self-disclosure and
						seeking help.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						These findings demonstrate that, unsurprisingly, learning environments intentionally designed to
						spotlight can encourage learners to notice purposeful objects and ponder upon curious ideas.
					</p>
					<h4>Variance</h4>
					<p class="mb-4">
						In a learning environment, objects and tools can also aid in focusing and “spotlighting”
						learners' attention. Spotlighting refers to the ability of a space, material, or object to
						enable a narrow line of attention. Spotlights can be predetermined for learners, or they can
						provide options for where and how they direct their focus.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						In addition to sensorial and tactile interventions, there are also advantages to employing
						contrast within the broader context of communities. For instance, communities that incorporate
						walkable paths and mixed-use buildings have been found to promote higher levels of trust, social
						engagement, and political participation among residents (Leyden, 2003). Unlike neighborhoods
						with homogenous forms and functions, neighborhoods with varying uses promote a sense of
						responsibility to a resident's own community. These mixed-use neighborhoods were seen to
						“[increase] individual calm, community trust and [decrease] perceived danger in researchlic
						space”
						(Zumelzu & Herrmann-Lunecke, 2021). Spaces with high use variance were also observed to elevate
						perceived social support and diminish social angst. Neighborhoods designed with qualities of
						contrast, through the incorporation of diversity and variation, can set the scene for learners
						to slow down, notice their environments, and bolster practices of communal help.
					</p>

				</div>
				<div class="col-md-12">
					<h3 class="mt-4">Flowing</h3>
					<p class="mb-4">
						Restricted movement or sedentary behavior in students has been associated with reduced
						engagement and focus among early adolescents (Kariippanon et al., 2020). Moreover, the ability
						to move and the quality of movement can support learners noticing, exploration, and curiosity
						(Leyden, 2003; Proulx et al., 2016). For example, spaces, objects, and materials with winding
						and non-linear pathways prompt participants to slow down and explore their surroundings
						(Hamilton-Baillie & Mitchell, 2020; Schlickman & Domlesky, 2019). What follows are several ways
						in which designers integrate a sense of flow, offering learners the freedom to reconfigure,
						control, manipulate, and adapt their environment in ways that inspire creativity and moments of
						wonder, leading to novel discoveries.
					</p>

					<h4>Curvature</h4>
					<p class="mb-4">
						Studies in urban design reveal how the layout of pathways can have a significant impact on the
						pace of human activity and interaction. Hamilton-Baillie & Mitchell (2020) found that drivers
						adjust their speed based on the formal characteristics of the road, such as its width and
						curvature. Narrow or curved roads that obscured the horizon resulted in slower driving speeds.
						The researchers observed that when drivers slow down, they become more aware of the environment
						and pay closer attention to their surroundings. The design of a pathway, whether it is a highway
						or a hallway, can influence where and how people redirect their attention.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						On a more personal scale, studies of interior design have shown that the shape of furniture can
						have a psychological impact on people. Dazkir & Read (2012) state that curvilinear furniture
						tends to elicit feelings of comfort, calmness, and peacefulness, more than rectilinear forms.
						This suggests that incorporating organic curves and shapes into learning spaces could create the
						psychological conditions that support help-seeking and help-giving behaviors. Designers should
						consider incorporating organic curves and shapes into spaces intended for help-seeking,
						noticing, and wondering, to influence how learners move through the given space.
					</p>
					<h4>Pausing</h4>
					<p class="mb-4">
						Pathways for movement can be designed to encourage individuals to slow down, pause, and notice.
						For instance, plazas designed with adjoining features such as extended sidewalks and adjacent
						pathways, can result in “pit-stopping,” where pedestrians slow down, linger, and gather
						spontaneously (Schlickman & Domlesky, 2019). On the other hand, plaza designs that have no
						obstructions, such as the "downstream" and "channelization,”, tend to attract larger and
						faster-moving crowds of people.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						Indoor spatial studies suggest similar findings. Museums often aim to elicit slow-paced
						experiences and promote exploration. Tzortzi (2014) suggests that museum layouts vary in how
						they guide their occupants, differing in global sequencing and local experiences, vastly
						affecting how visitors move through exhibits. Within museums, global sequences can range from
						linear to exploratory movement. Highly linear global sequencing resulted in a higher proportion
						of spaces visited but with less lingering and thematic connectedness. In contrast, less
						linearity, characterized by multiple pathways between exhibits, encouraged more movement and
						exploration across different exhibits.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						Collectively, these findings suggest that designing pathways as “pauseways” can foster behaviors
						where users shift their pace, slow down, and explore their surroundings.
					</p>
					<h4>Movement</h4>
					<p class="mb-4">
						While curved paths and pauseways promote practices of slowing down, noticing, and helping
						practices, other design choices that encourage movement and spatial familiarity can enhance
						learners’ creativity. Simply put, movement can stimulate various creative outcomes. (Fleury et
						al., 2020; Leung et al., 2012; Oppezzo & Schwartz, 2014). Leung et al. (2012) state that
						physical movement can improve performance in both divergent-thinking and convergent-thinking
						tasks, as moving between spaces without constraints can break down mental barriers that restrict
						creative cognition. In another study, Fleury et al. (2020) demonstrate the potential of “the
						visual perceptual component of movement” through virtual reality, suggesting that even
						perceptual movement, not just physical, can increase creative outcomes.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						These findings have prompted designers and researchers to develop Active Learning Environments
						(ALEs) as a response to the passive, inactive learning that commonly occurs in many classrooms
						(Talbert & Mor-Avi, 2019). ALEs have demonstrated positive effects on outcomes such as student
						achievement, engagement, autonomy, creativity, and noticing (Charteris, 2019; Davies et al.,
						2013; Kariippanon et al., 2020; Talbert & Mor-Avi, 2019). These learning environments frequently
						feature movable furniture that can be reconfigured to suit the space or occupant’s needs. Many
						of these spaces lack a defined front or back, serving as polycentric rooms that offer greater
						freedom of movement.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						In the aforementioned study on Van Eyck’s playgrounds, the researchers assert that “the
						availability of moveable play equipment supports creativity and diversity of play behaviors”
						(Jelic et al., 2020). Unrefined objects and materials like water, sand, wood, rocks, and
						vegetation provide students with the opportunity to "manipulate, adapt, construct, design,
						develop, and relocate equipment that develops their social and collaborative skills." The
						ability to modify one's surroundings is essential for individuals to feel in control of their
						learning and space.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						The concept of local familiarity plays a significant role in encouraging mobility. Research
						indicates that residents in walkable, mixed-use neighborhoods tend to have greater trust in
						others, greater social involvement, and greater political participation (Leyden, 2003). These
						neighborhoods foster an environment in which individuals can easily and comfortably navigate
						their surroundings, becoming familiar with their local context. This sense of familiarity and
						movement can lead to increased help-seeking and help-giving behaviors, as well as promote
						overall positive feelings of social connectedness and support. Proulx et al. (2016) assert that
						familiarity with one's neighborhood and the ability to move freely through it promote
						allocentrism—an attentional focus on other people. Specifically, the researchers suggest that
						having unrestricted movement within a neighborhood over time allows individuals to experience
						multiple pathways and perspectives, leading to the acquisition of allocentric knowledge. In
						contrast, disorderly neighborhood spaces or constrained local movement can result in a lack of
						familiarity and encourage egocentric behaviors, which in turn limits opportunities for both
						help-seeking and help-giving (Mou et al., 2004).
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-12">
					<h3 class="mt-4">Closeness</h3>
					<p class="mb-4">
						Although contrast and flow can enhance learning practices through surprise and movement,
						closeness and connectedness are also important qualities for creating social conditions that
						promote help-seeking, observation, and curiosity. Spaces that evoke feelings of closeness and
						connectedness foster relationships and a sense of inclusion within one's environment. In the
						following section, we will explore several ways in which designers can cultivate a sense of
						closeness through visibility, density, and a sense of belonging.
					</p>

					<h4>Visibility</h4>
					<p class="mb-4">
						The ability to see and make eye contact with others fosters opportunities for forming social
						connections. Studies indicate that a learner's sense of belonging to a group or community
						predicts their academic help-seeking behaviors (Dueñas et al., 2021; Won et al., 2021).
						Additionally, at the urban level, features such as front porches that allow for visibility from
						a building's exterior inward or having a front door instead of a side or back entrance are
						positively linked to perceived social support in a neighborhood (Brown, 2009; Spokane et al.,
						2007). Landmarks, which aid in spatial recognition, also help individuals navigate an area more
						easily (Mou et al., 2004). In short, elements that facilitate feelings of connectedness
						encourage social support and interpersonal communication. Conversely, studies suggest that a
						lack of invitations, such as closed curtains on front-facing windows, can lead to reduced
						opportunities for visibility and social support (Brown, 2009). However, it is important to note
						that, although visibility enables awareness of others, a loss of control over personal exposure
						can result in discomfort.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						The relationship between awareness, visibility, and help-seeking has also been thoroughly
						explored in the healthcare domain. Within healthcare clinics, open spaces, as opposed to
						enclosed, pod-like spaces, facilitated a higher frequency of unplanned and spontaneous instances
						of help-seeking among nursing staff (Real et al., 2017). According to Pati et al. (2016),
						enclosed pod-like spaces hinder communication among medical staff and patients, reducing their
						"capacity to extend or seek help due to a lack of awareness." Taking these findings into
						account, a study on classroom seating arrangements found that the same holds for children's
						question-asking. Placing students in a semicircular seating arrangement with unobstructed eye
						contact yielded a greater number of questions asked, in contrast to the row-and-column seating
						arrangements (Marx et al., 1999).
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						Hamilton-Baillie and Mitchell's (2020) research extends beyond enclosed spaces to describe the
						effect of visibility in an urban environment. When drivers have an unobstructed view of the
						horizon, they tend to drive at a faster speed. When their line of sight is occluded by a winding
						path or redirected to their surroundings, they are more likely to slow down and notice smaller
						details in their environment. Schlickman & Domlesky (2019) also studied the impact of visibility
						on plazas by incorporating spaces for performances and audiences. This design intervention
						resulted in most occupants, particularly teenagers, feeling comfortable in "entertainer" spaces
						because they could both observe their surroundings and be seen by others. By utilizing varying
						heights and ground levels, the design meets the needs of the occupants.
					</p>
					<h4>Compactness</h4>
					<p class="mb-4">
						The proximity between individuals emerges as a pivotal factor in nurturing a sense of closeness
						and connection. Extensive research has shed light on the impact of density levels, revealing
						that high levels of social density can exert adverse effects on social support and learning
						behaviors, particularly in the context of help-seeking. Spaces with higher densities have been
						linked to lower levels of support-seeking behavior, lower perceived support, and reduced support
						provision. Researchers suggest that this may be due to individuals feeling a lack of control or
						becoming overstimulated, leading to social withdrawal (Evans & Lepore, 1993).
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						With that in mind, the compactness of a community can also help facilitate socialization. Like
						varying neighborhoods, compact neighborhoods may offer a variety of spaces, like bars,
						restaurants, and coffee shops, as well as shorter distances to the city center, which encourages
						social interaction and support. Mouratidis (2018) addresses this phenomenon and explains that
						“even though compact-city residents may not even know the people living in the same apartment
						block, they do have more close relationships with which they socialize more frequently, and they
						receive more emotional and functional support as compared with residents of low-density
						suburbs.” As a result, compact neighborhoods allow people to maintain their existing
						relationships, which enhances their social support, and generates opportunities to develop new
						friendships and acquaintances, ultimately contributing to their overall social well-being.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						In the context of classrooms, Imms & Byers (2017) illustrate how many schools are experimenting
						with neighborhood-like designs that leverage the affordances of compactness. The establishment
						and maintenance of relationships can enhance people's ability to seek and provide social
						support.
					</p>
					<h4>Inclusivity</h4>
					<p class="mb-4">
						Visibility and density reveal interpersonal and urban conditions, however, at the community
						level, promoting a sense of inclusivity is crucial in fostering help-seeking behaviors. For
						example, when students are involved in the co-design of learning spaces, they feel a sense of
						ownership and belonging, which enables them to more comfortably rely on their peers for support
						and feedback, fostering closer relationships (Levy & Adjapong, 2020; Szatek, 2020). Explicit
						invitations for help-seeking can also promote inclusivity by challenging students’ “perceptions
						of the reactive and remedial nature of 'support’ and guidance” and dismantling the negative
						social connotations of help-seeking (Pillai, 2010).
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						Spatially, inclusivity can be manifested in “democratic classrooms.” Tannebaum and Tannebaum
						(2019) state that, democratic classrooms are emotionally supportive environments where students
						“can feel confident in their belief system and free to seek assistance from those around them.”
						Among students, classrooms with more comfortable peer relations demonstrated more help-seeking
						behaviors (Ryan et al., 2001). Implementing such spaces may involve showcasing student artwork
						or incorporating vibrant and colorful elements (Fedorenko, 2014; Milkie & Warner, 2011, as cited
						in Tannebaum & Tannebaum, 2019). Designing spaces for inclusivity seeks to foster connections
						among people and ultimately promote help-seeking and help-giving behaviors.

					<h3 class="mt-4">Conclusion</h3>
					<p class="mb-4">
						The research studies presented suggest three qualities of space, objects, and materials that
						support learning practices of noticing, wondering, and helping. The findings suggest that
						designs featuring qualities of contrasting, flowing, and closeness offer affordances for how
						learners learn. This paper is intended to provide design opportunities for designers to consider
						in learning spaces; from implementing curvilinear furniture forms to promoting comfort and
						help-seeking behaviors.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						To do so, designers could incorporate contrasting textures of materials to create multisensory
						experiences and create varying levels of visibility to influence how learners connect and feel
						connected. Moreover, the table below offers a reflective tool that operationalizes key findings
						into questions to consider when developing designs to support learning practices.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						While this tool attempts to integrate key ideas from the research into action, a keen reader
						might wonder whether some qualities inherently relate more to one learning practice than others.
						For example, studies suggest that qualities of contrast create conditions that tend to support
						practices of noticing. Designs that emphasize qualities of flowing and movement seem well suited
						to create affordances for practices of wondering. And help-seeking practices may be fostered by
						designing for qualities of closeness. While this may feel conceptually true, just as the
						learning practices should not be viewed as fully discrete categories, we encourage readers to
						consider the interrelationships between the qualities and the practices. Further applied
						research needs to be done to explore the connectivity and conceptual clarity between qualities
						and practices.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						Beyond the formal qualities of objects, materials, and space, the various studies cited in this
						paper raise the importance of considering the social-cultural context of design interventions.
						Though many interventions highlight the formal qualities of an object or space, such as the
						curvilinearity of furniture or paths, all interventions ultimately aim to change or support
						interactions among people. Therefore, socio-cultural issues such as power, identity, and values
						need to be understood and critically considered. Interventions that seek to create active
						learning environments, compact neighborhoods, and democratic classrooms need to take into
						consideration participants' cultural values to be effective. In other words, while the qualities
						of contrasting, closeness, and flowing occur in the formal, material, and environmental
						dimensions, designers also understand the sociocultural dimension of the design.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						Additionally, while the authors reviewed over a hundred articles for this white paper, some key
						and important studies were likely missed. For example, the literature review was limited to
						peer-reviewed articles in English. Key search terms for research studies were derived from
						phrases and concepts related to noticing, wondering, and helping learning practices.
						Peer-reviewed research journals were targeted, but not dissertations, books, or other resources.
						These and other choices we made may have led to oversights in finding and distilling additional
						studies that could have shaped the types of qualities we found.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						Designers and educators who are interested in creating environments that support learning should
						focus, not just on how spaces, objects, and materials lead to traditionally measured learning
						outcomes, but also on how the environment supports specific learning practices. Some qualities
						that support traditional learning outcomes, such as optimal stimulation and learner connection,
						seem connected to qualities that support learning practices, such as contrast and closeness.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						However, this paper offers a more nuanced view into specific sub-qualities, such as incongruity
						and sensory variance, that research suggests supporting practices of noticing, wondering, and
						helping. Environments for learning should be deliberately designed for how learning happens, in
						all its social complexity.
