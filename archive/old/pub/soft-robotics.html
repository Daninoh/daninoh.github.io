					<h3>Project Synopsis</h3>
					<p class="mb-4">
						"The Soft Robotics Toolkit aims to develop design engineering tools and kits for students,
						researchers, and hobbyist-makers to spark interest in soft robotics and catalyze new innovation
						in this exciting field. Soft robotics, as an emerging technology, has seen a steady increase in
						research activity over the last 10 years (in big part to being a focus area of the National
						Robotics Initiative), reaching a stage of maturity where the translation of knowledge to the
						researchlic is timely." <b>As learning designers, our task was to come up with a curriculum
							assessment strategy for the entry-level soft gripper kit.</b>
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-12">
					<h3 class="mt-4">Preliminary Research</h3>
					<p class="mb-4">
						Students today will enter ever-shifting job markets: the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs
						Report states that, in
						the next 10 years, “a non-negligible share of newly created jobs will be in wholly new
						occupations, or existing
						occupations undergoing significant transformations in terms of their content and skills
						requirements.” The report also
						highlighted “robotics specialists” as a role growing in demand (World Economic Forum, 2020).
						Recognizing that inherent
						identification with STEAM fields may not be available to all students, our assessment
						suggestions incorporate
						opportunities for all students to identify themselves as tinkerers, designers, and creators for
						their communities.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						We also prioritized design thinking as a means of developing social-emotional learning: not only
						will students gain a
						firsthand understanding of the engineering design process, but they will also develop
						collaboration skills,
						self-directedness, and communication abilities. We are emphasizing process-based over
						product-based assessment, as
						outcomes may be undetermined, open to further iteration, or misrepresentative of holistic
						learning (Graham, 2019). We
						see this in museum spaces as well. The Children’s Museum of Pittsburgh (Wardrip & Brahms, 2015)
						emphasizes learning
						practices over learning outcomes as seen in Figure 1, allowing for results to be undetermined
						and spontaneous and
						understanding that process is just as important as the result. Similarly, the Tinkering Studio
						at the Exploratorium
						(2017) provides educators with a framework centered on outcomes gained from learning experiences
						over tangible results
						(Figure 2). Finally, feedback as part of the cyclical nature of designing empowers students to
						have an “ongoing critical
						dialogue” (Pollock et al., 2015) with peers and programs; the studying of computer science
						itself also enables
						student-self directedness because of the instant feedback programs and products can provide
						(Brennan, 2021).
					</p>

				<div class="col-md-12">
					<h3 class="mt-4">Proposal Introduction</h3>
					<p class="mb-4">
						Our proposed learning goals encompass three domains: technical knowledge, design thinking, and
						socio-emotional learning.
						In developing our learning goals, we focused on how to develop effective assessments for
						teachers while still enabling
						creativity, imagination, and self-expression for learners. For our formative assessment, we
						propose a design journal
						students work on throughout the project; our summative assessment is an open-ended application
						project accompanied by a
						final gallery walk.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-12">
					<h3 class="mt-4">Formative Assessment: Design Journals</h3>
					<p class="mb-4">
						To meet the broad span of our learning goals and learner experiences, we designed an assessment
						that would evaluate not
						just the learner's final product, but their collective learning process. For our formative
						assessment, we decided on a
						design journal that students complete throughout the curriculum (Figure 3). Depending on the
						day, the journal prompts
						may be reflective or interactive and individual or collaborative. The built-in variety allows
						for the assessment of the
						variety of learning goals while serving different types of learners and needs throughout the
						curriculum. For example,
						earlier in the curriculum when students are building their technical knowledge, students might
						be asked to explain what
						an actuator is to a friend or family member. After building the autonomous gripper, however,
						students may benefit more
						from individual reflection and do a rose (what worked?), thorn (what was a challenge?), and bud
						(what new ideas sprung
						up?) activity. The different activities are designed around principles to assess student
						self-directed learning, which
						states that assessment should recognize the individuality of the learner, illuminate the
						learning process, engage
						multiple perspectives, and cultivate the capacity for personal judgment (Brennan et al., 2021).
						Additional design
						journal prompts (Figure 4) and sample slides can be found in the appendix (Figures 5-9).

					<p class="mb-4">
						Beyond assessment, the design journals also serve students by furthering their learning.
						Reflection is a key
						component of learning as it turns experiences into understanding. (Ellis et al., 2014) This is
						especially critical for
						hands-on and open-ended learning like soft robotics, where the ability to build does not always
						mean the ability to explain
						or transfer knowledge. Furthermore, reflection fosters meta-cognition skills that enable
						learners to become more
						flexible, growth-oriented learners (Boser, 2018). The growth mindset is fostered through the
						design journal with repeated
						prompts throughout the curriculum and activities that ask learners to look back and reflect on
						their newly gained
						understanding.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="col-md-12">
					<h3 class="mt-4">Summative Assessment: Application Project & Gallery Walk</h3>
					<p class="mb-4">
						Our framework also suggests the integration of a project-based summative assessment. While
						summative assessments
						generally aim to evaluate student learning through high stakes (Carnegie Mellon University,
						n.d.), we imagine a final
						project that focuses on the quality of the application and the depth of the process, rather than
						the evaluation of
						knowledge gains. Namely, we designed the project to challenge the learners’ contextual and
						technical understanding of
						soft robotics, help individual learners realize their potential roles in a collaborative STEAM
						environment, develop
						design thinking skills, and reconnect to their social and emotional growth.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						In efforts to design an equitable form of assessment, the project begins with an open-ended,
						individual prompt of
						brainstorming a novel soft robotics project. Nemiro, Larriva, and Jawaharlal (2015) suggest that
						“open-ended,
						challenging tasks that ask students to solve real-world problems” are ideal for encouraging a
						creative climate in a
						robotics classroom (p. 87). The loose nature of the prompt enables learners to approach the
						project from each
						individual’s unique perspective and skillset and potentially build intrinsic motivation within
						learners through
						self-developed project ideas (Castek et al., 2019). Once the learners have presented these ideas
						to their peers, they
						will be given the opportunity to form small groups (3-5 people) to design and fabricate a
						functional soft robotics
						project. For example, one group of learners may think of the project from a more conceptual lens
						and ideate an
						application of the soft robotics actuators in a new context, another group may tackle a
						functioning, incremental
						development of the soft gripper, and another group may create an expressive art project that
						incorporates pneumatic,
						silicone actuators. Based on the consensus of the learners, the facilitators might also provide
						sources to find existing
						applications of soft robotics for additional scaffolding.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						Learners will also be prompted to document their design process in their design journals,
						including anything that is not
						included in their final prototype. The documentation of the design process will assist learners
						in reflecting on their
						journey to becoming soft robotics technologists. Specifically, it will help students understand
						the iterative design
						cycle that is foundational to technological development (Nemiro et al., 2015). This
						documentation will go hand in hand
						with the design journal prompts to help connect the design project to our reflective probing
						questions.
					</p>
					<p>
						Finally, once the projects have been developed into a prototype, the students will present their
						work in a “gallery
						walk.” According to The Teacher Toolkit, a gallery walk is a “discussion technique [that] allows
						students to be actively
						engaged as they [...] share ideas and respond to meaningful questions, documents, images,
						problem-solving situations, or
						texts” (Education Service Center Region 13, n.d.). The gallery walk is designed to help
						presenters develop their oral
						and visual communication abilities and prompt listeners to extend their peer’s work through
						critique, feedback, and
						further ideation. We hope that the exposure of many different projects and ideas will foster an
						environment for
						divergent thinkers to explore the “adjacent possible” (Johnson, 2010, as cited by Graham, 2019).
