						What I’ve done for this course this week…
						<br>(1) Read <i>Applying Psychological Science to Higher Education: Key Findings and Open
							Questions</i> (Moulton 2014)
						<br>(2) Coded and set up my ePortfolio on my personal website
						<br>(3) Settled on my top choice of projects for the practicum
					</p><br>
					<h4><b>reading thoughts...</b></h4><br>
					<p>
						I always felt that there was <i>something</i> missing in my academic experiences learning about
						education and educational technologies. In his paper, Moulton describes the challenges that
						exist in the marriage between existing research and the practice of education. At first, I was
						reminded of <a target="_blank"
							href="https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/pdf/klahr/PDFs/Instructional%20Complexity.pdf">Koedinger,
							Booth, & Klahr (2013)</a> where they emphasize the complexities of learning science and
						develop a list of learning principles, but the more I read, the more I realized the focus was on
						finding the gaps in the bridge between practice and theory. It was refreshing to read something
						written about learning principles that isn’t obscure and verbose and really getting down to the
						essential (and extremely blunt) descriptions of the findings.
					</p><br>
					<p>
						Beyond the summaries of the existing research, I found the <i>Myths and Misconceptions</i>
						section to be the most evocative. Namely that (1) “there is no evidence that teachers should
						design instruction based on students’ learning styles,” (2) “the concept of ‘far transfer’, or
						the doctrine of formal discipline&mdash;is highly suspect,” (3) “with some exceptions for
						elementary and special education, neuroscience adds very little value to our practical
						understanding of learning and teaching,” and (4) “as indirect measures of learning, student
						ratings of instruction are neither worthless nor particularly useful.”
					</p><br>
					<p>
						Furthermore, I felt validated by the open questions and gaps Moulton points out, because many of
						these were the same questions I’ve been thinking about. These questions spanned from thinking
						about how we assess learners in different contexts to how we integrate evidence-based practices
						in classrooms and beyond to the trade-offs of having crammable lecture videos. All in all, I
						thought this paper provided a fantastic summary of known principles as well as a clear framework
						of potential research questions for educational researchers, educators, and learning designers.
					</p><br>
					<h4><b>my eportfolio</b></h4><br>
					<p>
						I spent a couple of hours setting up my ePortfolio for the Teaching and Learning Lab Practicum.
						This was a fun little design exercise, thinking about the most accessible format for the page.
						All in all, I’m happy with the current design, but open to future changes!
					</p><br>
					<img class="img-fluid" alt="screenshot of the webpage and code"
						src="../img/tll/webdesign.png"><br><br>
					<h4><b>project choice</b></h4><br>
					<p>
						Currently, I am very interested in both the <b>Anti-Racist Teaching Resources</b> project and
						the <b>Digital “Homepage” for New Online Program</b> project. Both of these projects seem to
						complement my current skillset, hopefully allowing me to participate and contribute to the team
						to a professional degree. After speaking with Bill, I am a bit more drawn towards the latter
						project, due to its early project scope and the potential for a lot more design problem
						thinking.

						<h3>&lt;&lt;
					</a>&nbsp; reflection week 4 [02/18/22]</h3>
					<p>
						What I’ve done for this course this week…
						<br>(1) Had my first meeting with Katherine and Bernard about the <b>Anti-Racist Teaching and
							Advising (ARTA)</b> Resources!
						<br>(2) [Briefly] learned about the history of learning design and some approaches to LD
						<br>(3) Connected the readings to my own undergraduate experience studying architecture
					</p><br>
					<h4><b>anti-racist teaching and adivising resources</b></h4><br>
					<p>
						<i>Why am I motivated to work on the ARTA resources?</i>
					</p><br>
					<p>
						Having taken several courses on equity and accessible design throughout my higher-ed experience,
						I am very hopeful to
						work on a DEIB initiative in a professional context. I am hoping to apply my own experiences and
						my learned knowledge to
						create some kind of platform that can accessibly educate individuals at HGSE (and more).
					</p><br>
					<p>
						One of the primary questions I had about this initiative was if it was a mandatory training
						program for HGSE educators,
						or if it was more of a supplementary resource. If it were up to me… it’d be mandatory! However,
						the answer to this
						question will heavily affect how I will plan on approaching this project.
					</p><br>
					<p>
						Beyond the meeting, I looked into several different DEIB resources at other universities
						including resources from
						Columbia University CTL, Wheaton College, University of Michigan, and Brown University. I’m
						excited to dive deeper to
						find more evocative and effective precedents that we might be able to bring into the HGSE
						community.
					</p><br>
					<h4><b>history of learning design</b></h4><br>
					<p>
						I was a bit curious about the differences between IDEO/Stanford d.school’s design process and
						the 5D Framework. I found
						that Discover correlated to Empathize and Define, Design to Ideate, Develop to Prototype,
						Deliver to Test, and Debrief
						to Assess. Perhaps there is a difference, but at first glance, I couldn’t tell. I was also very
						fascinated by the brief
						lesson on the history of learning design! I think this was the first time I have been exposed to
						this knowledge (in
						other courses I’ve heard about the history of multimedia and such, but not so much the
						theoretical basis of learning
						design). It was surprising to hear how late learning design actually entered the academic
						circle.
					</p><br>
					<h4><b>architecture & essential questions</b></h4><br>
					<p>
						I studied architecture for my undergraduate degree, and recently I was talking to one of my
						undergraduate friends about
						what was wrong with architectural pedagogy. I think we came to an understanding that our
						education never questioned,
						"why do we need to study architecture? What is the point of architecture for the researchlic,
						beyond
						"creating beautiful
						experiences? What can architecture do?" We can learn about the environmental and social effects
						of architecture, but
						without the underpinning framing of what architecture does for people, there becomes a focus on
						the built environment,
						rather than the people we design for.

						<h3>&lt;&lt;
					</a>&nbsp; reflection week 5 [02/25/22]</h3>
					<p>
						What I’ve done for this course this week…
						<br>(1) Second meeting with the team, discussing our initial interests and brainstorming initial
						ideas for our work
						<br>(2) Thought about the idea of <i>nuance</i> in relation to designing for disability, for
						learners, and broader design thinking.
					</p><br>
					<h4><b>meeting reflection and summary</b></h4><br>
					<p>
						Over the past week, I have been thinking about the scope and frame of this project. With a very
						loose guideline and
						understanding of the ARTA initiative, I answered four key questions to help set our design
						problem: (1) Who are my
						learners?, (2) What do I want learners to experience and do?, (3) What are some inspirational
						models and precedents we
						can look at?, and (4) Who do we need to reach out to for more guidance and what else do I need
						to know?
					</p><br>
					<p>
						<i>(1) Who are my learners?</i><br>
						If we can turn this into a mandatory training program, I would like to create a project that
						teaches all faculty at
						HGSE. However, if that is out of the scope, I am also interested in creating a platform for
						faculty who either get
						referred to these resources or are interested in learning more about the ARTA framework.
					</p><br>
					<p>
						<i>(2) What do I want learners to experience and do?</i><br>
						I’m hoping that we can tackle the process of learning to unlearn. With this specific project, I
						want to see if we can
						design a tool that informs faculty in their interpersonal communities and classrooms. Perhaps
						this includes interactive
						training? In the end, I want to create a platform that the faculty at HGSE will not be
						overwhelmed with, but also
						transformative to their thinking, teaching, and curriculum.
					</p><br>
					<p>
						<i>(3) What are some inspirational models and precedents we can look at?</i><br>
						I thought about it in three different scopes, what’s not working, what looks effective, and what
						looks interesting. A
						few resource collections I have found did not work due to the sheer amount of text and
						hyperlinks on a single page
						(<a target="_blank"
							href="https://www.educause.edu/about/diversity-equity-and-inclusion/resources">EduCause</a>,
						<a target="_blank"
							href="https://www.brown.edu/sheridan/teaching-learning-resources/inclusive-teaching/effective-teaching-anti-racist-teaching">Brown
							University</a>). However, resources with a <a target="_blank"
							href="https://wheatoncollege.edu/academics/special-projects-initiatives/center-for-collaborative-teaching-and-learning/anti-racist-educator/">focus
							on hierarchy</a> or an innovative solution through a <a target="_blank"
							href="https://wheatoncollege.edu/academics/special-projects-initiatives/center-for-collaborative-teaching-and-learning/anti-racist-educator/">dedicated
							curriculum</a> seemed like more effective methods of teaching faculty. Lastly, I found a VR
						project called <a target="_blank"
							href="https://cogburnresearchgroup.socialwork.columbia.edu/research-projects/1000-cut-journey">1,000
							Cut
							Journey</a> from Columbia University that seemed very interesting. I am interested in seeing
						if there are more anti-racist
						initiatives that are as interactive and engaging as this!
					</p><br>
					<p>
						<i>(4) Who do we need to reach out to for more guidance and what else do I need to know?</i><br>
						I would love some more precedent models and projects to work off of. If we knew of any
						interesting media projects like
						the 1,000 Cut Journey, that would be phenomenal (riffing off of Bernard’s comment, maybe a
						chatbot already exists as a
						precedent?).<br><br>

						I would also love to hold a conversation with any faculty who is currently working in DEIB,
						right now (the first people
						that come to mind are Dr. Josephine Kim and Dr. Gretchen Brion-Meisels, but I’m open to
						anyone!). I want a better
						framework to work with, instead of trying to create something blindly. What are some issues
						faculty are seeing with
						current DEIB initiatives? What resources are people exposed to and what are their means of
						access?
					</p><br>
					<p>
						<i>Currently, Bern and I are beginning to think about a collaborative project, incorporating
							some of the features of the
							precedent project we have looked into – in order to create an engaging, interactive platform
							with reduced cognitive
							load.</i>
					</p><br>
					<h4><b>nuance in design</b></h4><br>
					<p>
						This week had a lot of ‘big idea’ overlap between all of my courses and work. Specifically, in
						between thinking about
						designing spaces and objects for disabled folks (with <a target="_blank"
							href="https://sarahendren.com/">Sara Hendren</a> in her amazing course, Investigating
						Normal), to
						designing for children (with Mitch Resnick in Learning Creative Learning and my teaching
						position with Bertrand
						Schneider), to designing for learners–there was a floating term that seemed to encapsulate my
						week, nuance.
					</p><br>
					<p>
						In response to my question to last week, where I asked if there is a difference between the 5D
						‘waterfall’ flow and the
						IDEO design thinking ‘recipe,’ while it isn’t quite highlighted in the actual simplified
						depictions, the differences
						lies in the nuances between designing for a general user base and designing for specific
						learners.
					</p><br>
					<p>
						As designers, we have to be aware of the unique affordances of each of our clients and users.
						Just as the needs and pain
						points of disabled individuals are different from children, we have to be aware of the nuances
						between each individual
						within that subcategory. While design thinking often aims to create a solution through a
						hypothetical persona generated
						from a selected group of people, I challenge this idea and imagine a design process that
						incorporates an individualized
						solution through co-design. One amazing precedent we discussed is the <a target="_blank"
							href="https://www.adaptivedesign.org/">ADA (Adaptive Design Association)</a>, where they
						design furniture and other artifacts through one-on-one, personal customization with affordable
						materials. This personal
						relationship between the designer and user results in a product where the actual end user is a
						part of the ideation
						process. I begin to wonder if I could think about incorporating this into the ARTA initiative…

					</a>&nbsp; reflection week 7</h3>
					<h4><b>meeting reflections</b></h4><br>
					<p>
						In the past two weeks, our team (Katherine, Bern and I) discussed the scope, framework,
						schedule, and stakeholders in which the
						ARTA initiative spans. In response to week 4 and week 5, Bern and I determined that it was
						imperative to our design
						process to meet with the different stakeholders who are currently working on DEIB initiatives at
						HGSE, the faculty who
						will be using the ARTA resource collection, and the students who will be primarily affected by
						it. From Bern and
						Katherine’s conversation with Josh Bookin, as well as planned conversations with Sara O’Brien,
						the pedagogy specialist
						for the Instructional Moves project, we gained (and hope to further gain) insight into existing
						DEIB frameworks at HGSE,
						how we might frame the ARTA project within the Instructional Moves project, and how we might
						best create a platform that
						engages all faculty.

						<img class="img-fluid " alt="proposed schedule, prototyping stage occurs after week 9"

					<p>
						Beyond these meetings, we have begun brainstorming and consolidating our findings into a
						singular project. This has been
						initiated in Miro, with hopes that we can put down all of our floating thoughts and create an
						effective and
						collaborative final artifact. My current vision includes a website in which the content is
						guided by the principal of
						learner agency. We also discussed how important it was for the team to interweave a level of
						transparency in the
						project. That is, we want to make sure students, faculty, and staff could visit this resource
						and have information on
						exactly what this initiative is about, what equity initiatives exist at HGSE, how this affects
						faculty and students, and
						a history of the ARTA framework. We believe that in clarity and transparency there is power to
						the community.

						<h3>&lt;&lt;
					</a>&nbsp; reflection week 8</h3>
					<h4><b>equity and CBEs</b></h4><br>
					<p>
						I'm absolutely conflicted on the cost benefit of Competency Based Education in terms of equity.
						While I agree that CBEs
						enable individuals who aren't able to pursue a 'traditional' education path to both learn and
						get credentials, it is
						undeniable that many employers and professionals put value into institutional prestige. When we
						think of CBEs in the
						bubble of education and learning, separated from industry, CBEs are certainly effective in
						engaging individuals with
						their specific educational needs. However, reality shows that there are industry leaders,
						professionals, and employers
						who value their own perception of quality over qualification. Equitable education is about more
						than just having access
						to credentials and platforms for learning -- it should be able to provide the same levels of
						opportunities. But I see
						this as not an issue with CBEs, but a systemic issue.
					</p><br>
					<p>
						On a different note, I find that in fields where competency can be proven with supplementary
						evidence, CBEs are much
						more effective. That is, in fields like design and software development, students leave with
						both a credential, showing
						competency as evaluated by an <i>external</i> institute or person, and a complementary portfolio
						that a potential employer can
						evaluate themselves. Companies and employers who are recognized as industry leaders are
						employing more and more
						professionals without degrees, due to the rising enrollment in Bootcamps. While I understand
						that CBEs and Bootcamps are
						not necessarily the same, perhaps the production of external portfolios, beyond the fields of
						design and computer
						science, may benefit in exhibiting the competencies of those who complete their studies? I think
						my biggest issue with
						credentials and accreditation is that it sets up a system where an employer relies on a third
						party to evaluate the
						competencies of an individual. In this vein, I think CBEs are generally seen as a credential of
						less quality, due to how
						much this employer trusts or values this third party, rather than the individual. Perhaps
						there's a way we can think
						about integrating demonstrable skills into every industry -- in the form of nicely packed case
						studies or inquiry into
						previously completed projects.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						While I was writing up my response all I could think about was... why do we need credentials? In
						my perspective,
						credentials are for corporations with capitalist needs who need a way to discern the ability of
						a prospective employee
						(which I am clearly and unfortunately subscribed to, per my decision to join this program). In a
						disability design
						course, I recently read a paper called <i>These Pushful Days</i> by Douglas Baynton, which
						talked about concepts such as crip
						time and how modern industry has created an environment where many inequities, especially for
						persons with disabilities,
						are formed by the conceptualization of life as a race. With this in mind, I wonder what
						industries might look like if
						employers took the time to get to know someone's capabilities beyond one to two interviews,
						rather than relying on a
						quick scan of credentials, which shows competency as evaluated by an external entity. I think
						this is why ePortfolios
						might be a great tool in all industries. With ePortfolios or any medium in which an individual
						can wrap up previous
						experiences or competencies in a digestible format, there might be less reliance on credentials,
						and as Julia Kim put it --
						get closer to educational liberation!
					</p><br>
					<h4><b>capstone progress</b></h4><br>
					<p>
						Over the past two weeks I went through all the meeting notes from internal and external meetings
						and created a
						summary/debrief section in Miro. I also began questioning how I might better situate this
						capstone within the content
						and scope of T127 and how I might better incorporate the learning principles we have been
						reading and discussing about
						over the past several months.
					</p><br>
					<div class="col-md-12">
						<img class="img-fluid " alt="collection of sticky notes summarizing meetings"
							src="../img/tll/conversation-learning.png"><br><br>
					</div>
					<p>
						My current goal for the capstone is designing a platform that enables faculty and staff at HGSE
						to learn and apply
						various instructional and advising ‘techniques’ in an interactive manner. This might take form
						in an account-based
						platform, where learners can either follow scaffolded learning pathways, create personal
						collections of resources,
						view a collective list of resources, and learn about how they might take action in anti-racist
						strategies. Beyond this, I
						am also very interested in situating the ARTA framework within the greater scope of DEIB
						initiatives at HGSE. It has
						come to my attention, from conversations and research, that there are many small initiatives –
						from student-led to
						institutional practices – that are scattered throughout the Harvard database. I believe the ARTA
						initiative might be
						a good place to coalesce all of these previous resources and initiatives to better approach DEIB
						work as a collective
						community. I’ve also begun (mostly for fun) taking a stab at smaller design considerations.

					</p><br>
					<p>
						The first three courses, on haptics, mechatronics, and TinyML, all required external toolkits
						which students would have
						to purchase (ranging from $50 - $250), which is a limitation of the course topic due to the
						physical requirements of
						learning about robots and microcontrollers. Due to my personal interest in these topics
						(intrinsic motivation), the
						lecture videos from the Haptics, Mechatronics, and TinyML were all fascinating (especially the
						first two). The
						production quality and depth of the Haptics course, integrating application, personal at home/at
						desk experiments, and a
						personal touch (through digital sketching from the lecturer over a presentation) helped me feel
						like I was in a
						synchronous lecture. While the lecturer's face was not visible for a majority of the lecture,
						the digital hand sketching
						in the presentation helped me feel like I was actually listening to a lecturer. The Mechatronics
						course was similar in
						the high quality of the videos. However, these videos felt far more rehearsed and formal (which
						I personally did not
						enjoy as much). On the other hand, while the quality of the course videos and course materials
						for both of the HarvardX
						courses were fantastic, I quickly gave up on both due to the sheer amount of time it took for me
						to read a chapter for
						the TinyML course [and also the daunting 8-10 different sections in each module] and watch to a
						1.5 hour long video for
						the CS50 course [which I might finish when I have more time, after April].
					</p><br>
					<p>
						As I am not personally interested in credentials and getting verified certificates (and even
						more so paying for it), I
						was not thrilled by the courses with longer quizzes. The Mechatronics course did a fantastic job
						in prompting only a
						couple (2-3) questions per 5-15 minute lecture video. These lectures would then be supplemented
						by a lab assignment,
						which enrolled students could submit.
					</p><br>
					<p>
						On the subject of community, I wasn't thrilled by the course format of the CS50 course. However,
						I did appreciate that
						the introduction of the course included VARIOUS (instagram, discord, twitter, etc.) social media
						platforms where
						students could collect and connect. The Mechatronics course, on the other hand, included two
						different forums for Q&A,
						where TAs and the instructor would be active in, and a Get to Know Each Other forum, where only
						students would (maybe)
						be active in. Considering that these forums were integrated into the edX platform, I do not
						foresee many people
						utilizing it. Whereas, the community platforms that CS50 uses are ubiquitous and easily
						accessible.
					</p><br>
					<p>
						Overall, I loved the courses with short bursts of information, so I could approach each section
						with less fear and
						preparation, and also appreciate a less formal lecture environment (after all, in higher-ed
						institutions, we have
						professors who don't memorize a certain script and explain things as they go).
					</p><br>
					<h4><b>capstone progress</b></h4><br>
					<p>
						I am ready to begin creating the visual design [wireframes & more]! I’ve taken the past week to
						synthesize our many
						findings from talks and organize my thoughts from last week (theories of andragogy, elements
						needed in this platform,
						etc). While I am a little bit behind schedule, where I would have ideally done lo-fi prototypes
						by now, I am glad that
						we took a bit more time to think about all our end users, and what this platform might signify
						for the future of the
						ARTA initiative.
					</p><br>
					<p>
						In terms of end users, I’ve organized the current website framework by <b>paddlers, swimmers,
							and divers</b>. This is a
						technique I learned while interning at a natural history museum, where exhibit designers need to
						create exhibits that
						are curated to those who will simply gaze and walk past an exhibit, those who will stand and
						read some of the
						descriptions, and those who will really engage with an exhibit. As noted in my last reflection,
						this platform aims, both
						in the framing of paddler, swimmers, and divers <i>and</i> in the frame of adult learning, to
						provide multiple ways of engaging
						with anti-racist resources. The Instructional Moves Pathways are foundational for how this
						platform would work, focusing
						on pathways that feature videos with curated resources (and summaries), followed by applied
						scenarios (in video form,
						just like IM), and a short self-reflection at the end of these videos. Furthermore, taking input
						from Bill, I have
						implemented a community section to this platform.
					</p><br>
					<p>
						The following diagram shows a visual representation of the current draft of the platform’s
						architecture and potential
						user flows:

					<h4><b>some next steps...</b></h4><br>
					<p>
						In the following week I will design low/mid fidelity prototypes for these pages. Furthermore, I
						will be attending two different user tests (Adjunct Lecturer and Associate Professor) with Sara
						O'Brien on the Instructional Moves project, in hopes to learn more about the faculty perspective
						in Anti-Racist resources.

					</a>&nbsp; reflection week 12</h3>
					<h4><b>capstone progress</b></h4><br>
					<p>
						The past couple of weeks have been full of meetings, user tests, and prototyping. From
						conversations and meetings with
						both the internal Anti-Racist Teaching and Advising and Instructional Moves team, several
						stakeholders (various
						higher-ed educators), and peers interested in DEIB at HGSE, I was able to develop a prototype of
						a ‘container’ for the
						ARTA competencies. The prototype was highly inspired by the IM user-tests, especially taking
						into consideration what
						educators would like to see, first and foremost, on the IM pathways (e.g. explicit strategies
						for instructing, methods
						and deeper research, reflective questions interspersed in the content). This project also takes
						into consideration the
						various scattered initiatives and actions on DEIB that have occured/are occurring within our
						institution, through the
						proposal of a DEIB timeline that faculty, students, and staff can view and take into account for
						any future work on
						equity at the Graduate School of Education.
					</p><br>
					<p>
						After a couple of iterations and revisions I have come up with sketched out mid-fi prototypes,
						as well as digitized
						versions (in-progress). These prototypes will be reviewed by the ISD team (Josh Bookin, Ivonne
						Garcia, and Allison
						Pingree) later this week for user-testing and critique.

					</div>
					<p>
						As seen above, there have been considerations for a community page on this prototype, where
						faculty can find communities
						of practice to keep each other accountable–or even just find other faculty who are open to
						deeper conversations on
						anti-racism in the classroom. While some development of this element has been made (including
						the simplification into a
						potential guideline to maintaining a community of practice or finding accountability peers), due
						to feasibility and time
						constraints, I plan on keeping the community page a sketch as I design and build out the higher
						fidelity prototype.
						More details on this prototype will be provided next week.

					</a>&nbsp; reflection week 13</h3>
					<h4><b>capstone progress</b></h4><br>
					<p>
						This week, I began developing my hi-fidelity prototype for the ARTA resources and presented my
						work to the ISD team
						(Josh, Ivonne, and Allison). The hi-fidelity prototype uses the paddler, swimmer, diver
						framework to organize its
						contents. For example, a faculty member may only have the capacity to browse through the initial
						list of competencies.
						In the homepage, they are able to scroll through the list of competencies with a brief summary
						of each. If a faculty
						member is feeling a bit more adventurous, they are able to click on a competency and read
						through some of the strategies
						they might approach to achieve the competency. If the faculty member really wants to dive into
						actionable steps and
						learn more about existing resources, they will be able to click on a strategy which will lead to
						a pop-up of related
						resources.
					</p><br>
					<div class="col-lg-8 mx-auto px-0">
						<img class="img-fluid " alt="hi fidelity gif of website"
							src="../img/tll/hi-fidelity.gif"><br><br>
					</div>
					<p>
						The resources page also takes into consideration a personalization feature, where a learner is
						able to filter the
						colossal list of resources available and save specific, standout resources to their homepages. I
						was imagining that this
						would be done either through browser cookies or a HarvardKey account.
					</p><br>
					<div class="col-lg-12 mx-auto px-0">
						<img class="img-fluid " alt="hi fidelity screenshot of resource pop out"
							src="../img/tll/resourcespage.png"><br><br>
					</div>
					<p>
						From my meeting with the ISD team, I learned a lot more about existing communities of practice
						on anti-racism at HGSE.
						Specifically, Josh listed (1) Conversations on Race and Racism, (2) the Faculty of Color group,
						and (3) Developing as
						Anti-Racist White Educators. Perhaps the community page on the ARTA resource page could be a
						platform of conversation
						for these communities–either guiding newer faculty to these existing communities or helping
						facilitate conversations
						within these communities (I’m more inclined to pursue the second).
					</p><br>
					<p>
						As this semester wraps up and the gallery walk approaches, I will be finishing up the
						hi-fidelity prototype (the about
						page), adding more interactions, and organizing my capstone into a two minute elevator pitch. I
						plan on framing
						everything around the paddler, swimmer, diver framework and discussing some of my larger design
						decisions (i.e. reason
						for the inclusion of specific pages).

					<h4><b>final reflection</b></h4><br>
					<p>
						The past several weeks in this course have been a wonderful learning experience. I really
						appreciate the organization of the course, especially providing us time to just learn about
						learning and designing in the beginning and providing us plenty of support and time to wrap up
						our newfound understanding in our capstones. While I had no initial desire to
						learn about MOOCs and Open Learning, as I had some exposure to it in undergrad and wasn’t too
						interested, I’m thankful that this course helped me critique/appreciate it and see it in a
						different lens.
					</p><br>
					<p>
						I would also say that, due to the remote nature of the course, and the slightly disjointed
						communities created by the different project teams, I wasn’t able to feel the same level of
						community in this course as my other courses. While I completely understand that the class being
						remote limits certain aspects, I wish there were more opportunities for me to
						connect with my peers throughout this course. Considering that there were a couple of people
						pursuing completely different projects through the Teaching and Learning Lab, it would have been
						fantastic to be able to connect with people beyond my smaller team – both in terms of getting
						feedback and receiving different perspectives (after all, interdisciplinary work is a phenomenal
						way of working).
					</p><br>
					<p>
						Beyond this social aspect, which might just be the case for me, I’m thankful for the breadth of
						knowledge and concepts we covered in this course and I’m excited to take everything forward into
						my future work! Working with the ARTA (special thanks to Katherine!) and Instructional Moves
						team was a fantastic opportunity, especially in terms of understanding what learning designers
						do and how the curation of learning material happens. I am glad that I was able to be a part of
						a team pursuing such a challenging initiative, and I hope that my work will be beneficial to the
						future work of the team!
